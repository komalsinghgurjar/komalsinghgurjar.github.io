<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [DD Month YYYY]</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Typist (“the App”) is an offline Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how information is
handled when you use the App.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
The App does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit personal data</strong> for analytics,
advertising, profiling, or tracking purposes.
</p>
<p>
All OCR processing is performed <strong>entirely on the user’s device</strong>.
</p>

<h2>3. Images and Text Processing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images selected by the user are processed locally on the device.</li>
    <li>Recognized text remains on the device.</li>
    <li>No images or extracted text are uploaded to any server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The App does not retain images or recognized text unless the user explicitly saves them.
</p>

<h2>4. Crash Reporting (ACRA)</h2>
<p>
The App uses <strong>ACRA (Application Crash Reports for Android)</strong> for crash reporting
to improve app stability.
</p>
<p>
When a crash occurs, a crash report may be sent <strong>via email</strong>. This report may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Android version</li>
    <li>Device model and manufacturer</li>
    <li>Stack trace and technical error information</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>No personal user data, images, or OCR content are included</strong> in crash reports.
Crash reports are used solely for debugging and improving the App.
</p>

<h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
The App does not require an internet connection for OCR functionality.
</p>
<p>
Internet access may be used only for optional features such as sending crash reports
or downloading optional language data in future versions.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App does not use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising SDKs</li>
    <li>Analytics services</li>
    <li>Cloud-based OCR services</li>
</ul>
<p>
ACRA is used solely for crash reporting and operates within the scope described above.
</p>

<h2>7. Permissions</h2>
<p>
The App may request permissions such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Media / Storage access</strong> – to allow users to select images for OCR</li>
</ul>
<p>
Permissions are used only for their stated purpose and not for data collection.
</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Since the App performs OCR locally and does not transmit user content,
there is minimal risk of data exposure through external servers.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated as new features are added.
Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
</p>
